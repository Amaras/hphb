# Harry Potter: Hogwarts Battle

Harry Potter: Hogwarts Battle is a cooperative, deck-building board game where you play as the heroes from the Harry Potter franchise against some of the villains.

This project is a recreation on a computer as a means of learning the Rust language, and for my private use.
I do not claim to own the game, its concept, or any part of the Harry Potter franchise.
